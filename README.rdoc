This is a music streaming application I created with Ruby on Rails, Shopify, PostgreSQL, Amazon S3, AJAX, Bootstrap, and JQuery. It allows Users to sign up for an account, login, upload songs, stream songs, and buy/sell songs. You can stream the songs continuously throughout the application. And you can purchase songs through Shopify.

I am still adding features to the application and changing things, but it is functional. I have deployed the application on Heroku for testing: https://tuneify-shop.herokuapp.com/
